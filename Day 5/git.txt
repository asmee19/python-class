# Git is a version control system

# Why do we need git?
=> It is used for version controlling
=> It is used in team collaboration

# Where do we store our code?
=> In github / gitlab / bitbucket
=> Github / gitlab / bitbucket understands the git language
=> Github and gitlab are the cloud based software solution (web-application) running in the web, which understands
the git terminologies and makes team collaboration easier.

Q. Why not google drive? onedrive?
=> Google drive / onedrive doesn't understand the git language (commits, branches,
staging area and so on)
=> Team collaboration is also not so helpful in cloud based drives

what is repository(repo)?

It is simply project folder in git

#lets initiate a git repo
    git init
    git add .
      => it makes your code recognize to staging area 

    git commit -m "commit message"
    => saving your codes and creating a new checkpoint
    => It only saves the code in staging area
